In today’s world, many new species of birds are being discovered and many more species are on the verge of becoming extinct. The issue that arises is to identify and differentiate the species so that we can classify them appropriately and take necessary measures to preserve the species. This demonstrates the necessity of developing an algorithm that can accurately predict bird species from their sounds. This research uses data from Xento-Canto to perform analysis and examine the accuracy of Neural Networks in predicting bird species based on their sound. Two models were developed to make predictions. The first model using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to perform binary classification of two species has predicted the bird species with a test accuracy of 96.9%. The second model using CNN to perform multi-class classification of 12 species has predicted the bird species with a test accuracy of 68.3%.
